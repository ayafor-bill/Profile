## Security Projects
### Fraud-Resistant Local Attendance System
Designed a local-only network system to prevent impersonation and replay attacks in academic environments.

I prioritize understanding **why vulnerabilities exist**, not just how to exploit them.  
My goal is to operate as a junior penetration tester who can communicate risk clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
